= JimmyJukebox

== DESCRIPTION

JimmyJukebox plays MP3 and OGG songs in specified directory trees in random order.
You can pause/unpause a playing song, skip a song, or quit. By default, JimmyJukebox 
will play (in random order) all .mp3 and .ogg files in your '~/Music' directory. 
You can override this default either by passing a directory name as a command line 
parameter (example: "play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ") or by passing the name of a file 
containing a list of directory names.

== REQUIREMENTS
 - A Unix/Linux/Mac machine -- JimmyJukebox currently does not run on Windows
 - The command line program "mpg123" (if you want to play MP3 files)
 - The command line program "ogg123" (if you want to play OGG files)
 - A non-JRuby Ruby (because JRuby does not support "fork"... see TROUBLESHOOTING below)

== BASIC USAGE
 - On the command line, type "play_jukebox"
 - By default, JimmyJukebox assumes your music is stored in a directory tree descending from "~/Music"
 - A song will start playing
 - To skip to the next song, type "s<RETURN>"
 - To pause the song, type "p<RETURN>"
 - To restart a paused song, type "p<RETURN>"
 - To quit, type "q<RETURN>" or "<CTRL>-C"

== TELLING JIMMYJUKEBOX WHERE TO FIND YOUR MUSIC

Method 1 selects just one music directory:
 - On the command line, type "play_jukebox DIRECTORY_NAME" where DIRECTORY_NAME is the path to the top of your music directory tree
 - If your directory name contains characters that must be escaped, you can either escape them or enclose the string in double quotation marks
 - For example:
    - play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ
    - play_jukebox ~/Music/The\ Beatles
    - play_jukebox "~/Music/The Beatles"
    - play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ/Jack\ Sheedy\'s\ Dixieland\ Jazz\ Band
    - play_jukebox "~/Music/JAZZ/Jack Sheedy's Dixieland Jazz Band"

Method 2 selects one or more music directories:
 - Create a ~/.jimmy_jukebox directory
 - Create a file (or files) in ~/.jimmy_jukebox named whatever you want but ending in ".txt"
    - ~/.jimmy_jukebox/jazz.txt
    - ~/.jimmy_jukebox/rock.txt
    - ~/.jimmy_jukebox/country.txt
    - etc.
 - Inside each file, each row names the top of a music directory tree (no need to escape spaces and other frequently escaped characters)
    - For example, ~/.jimmy_jukebox/rock.txt might contain the following:
        ~/My_rock_files/The_Beatles
        ~/My_rock_files/The Eagles
        /home/my_name/My_rock_files/The_Rolling_Stones
 - To play music stored in the directory trees specified in ~/.jimmy_jukebox/jazz.txt, run "play_jukebox jazz.txt"

== TROUBLESHOOTING

- Are you running a Windows machine? Solution: Get a real Unix/Linux/Mac.

- Are you running JRuby? Solution: Set your GEM_HOME and PATH variables to call "Matz" Ruby (aka CRuby or regular Ruby) before calling JRuby (OPTIONAL: then contact the JRuby gurus and very nicely encourage them to enable "fork")

If you're a JRuby user (like me), you may be disappointed that JimmyJukebox doesn't work with JRuby. JRuby generates a "NotImplementedError: fork is not available on this platform" exception because "JRuby doesn't implement fork() on any platform, including those where fork() is available in MRI" (http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/DifferencesBetweenMriAndJruby#Fork_is_not_implemented). There is an experimental "fork" feature in JRuby callable on the command line with "-J-Djruby.fork.enabled=true" but the feature is labelled "(EXPERIMENTAL, maybe dangerous)" (see http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/PerformanceTuning#Native_Support_Runtime_Properties).
