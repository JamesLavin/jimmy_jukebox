= JimmyJukebox

== DESCRIPTION

JimmyJukebox enables you to: 1) Play your music; and, 2) Download wonderful old jazz

JimmyJukebox plays MP3/OGG songs in specified directory trees in random order.
You can pause/unpause a playing song, skip a song, or quit. By default, JimmyJukebox 
will play (in random order) all .mp3 and .ogg files in your '~/Music' directory. 
You can override this by passing a directory name as a command line  parameter
(example: "play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ") or by passing the name of a file containing
a list of directory names.

JimmyJukebox also enables you to download thousands of great jazz performances by Art
Tatum, Bennie Moten, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, Charlie Christian, Count Basie,
Dizzy Gillespie, Django Reinhardt, Fletcher Henderson, Jelly Roll Morton, Lionel Hampton,
Louis Armstrong, and the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.

== REQUIREMENTS
 - Linux/Unix:
   - Install the command line program "mpg123" (to play MP3 files)
   - Install the command line program "ogg123" (to play OGG files)
 - Mac:
   - No additional requirements. Should play songs using built-in "afplay." But
     currently testing. "Skip" function doesn't seem to work.
 - Windows:
   - JimmyJukebox currently does not currently run on Windows, though we hope to get
     it working
 - JRuby:
   - I love JRuby, but JimmyJukebox does not currently work on JRuby because JRuby does
     not support "fork" (see TROUBLESHOOTING below)

== QUICK-START INSTRUCTIONS
 - Download music: "load_jukebox [artist name]" (see next section)
 - Play music: "play_jukebox"

== BASIC USAGE - DOWNLOADING MUSIC

 - On the command line:
   - "load_jukebox at" to download music by Art Tatum
   - "load_jukebox bm" to download music by Bennie Moten
   - "load_jukebox bg" to download music by Benny Goodman
   - "load_jukebox bh" to download music by Billie Holiday
   - "load_jukebox cc" to download music by Charlie Christian
   - "load_jukebox cc" to download music by Count Basie
   - "load_jukebox dg" to download music by Dizzy Gillespie
   - "load_jukebox dr" to download music by Django Reinhardt
   - "load_jukebox fh" to download music by Fletcher Henderson
   - "load_jukebox jrm" to download music by Jelly Roll Morton
   - "load_jukebox lh" to download music by Lionel Hampton
   - "load_jukebox la" to download music by Louis Armstrong
   - "load_jukebox odjb" to download music by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band

 - By default, music will be downloaded to a directory under "~/Music/JAZZ/", like
   "~/Music/JAZZ/Original_Dixieland_Jazz_Band" (and that directory will be created 
   automatically). To specify a different directory, type the full directory path after
   "load_jukebox", e.g.: 'load_jukebox "/home/my_name/MyMusic/Jazz/ODJB"'. Place the
   directory path in quotation marks if it contains any spaces or other "unusual" characters.

== BASIC USAGE - PLAYING MUSIC
 - On the command line, type "play_jukebox"
 - By default, JimmyJukebox assumes your music is stored in a directory tree descending from "~/Music"
 - A song will start playing
 - To skip to the next song, type "s<RETURN>"
 - To pause the song, type "p<RETURN>"
 - To restart a paused song, type "p<RETURN>"
 - To quit, type "q<RETURN>" or "<CTRL>-C"

== TELLING JIMMYJUKEBOX WHERE TO FIND YOUR MUSIC

Method 1 selects just one music directory tree:
 - On the command line, type "play_jukebox DIRECTORY_NAME" where DIRECTORY_NAME is the path to the top of your music directory tree
 - If your directory name contains characters that must be escaped, you can either escape them or enclose the string in double quotation marks
 - For example:
    - play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ
    - play_jukebox ~/Music/The\ Beatles
    - play_jukebox "~/Music/The Beatles"
    - play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ/Jack\ Sheedy\'s\ Dixieland\ Jazz\ Band
    - play_jukebox "~/Music/JAZZ/Jack Sheedy's Dixieland Jazz Band"

Method 2 selects one or more music directory trees:
 - Create a ~/.jimmy_jukebox directory
 - Create a file (or files) in ~/.jimmy_jukebox named whatever you want but ending in ".txt"
    - ~/.jimmy_jukebox/jazz.txt
    - ~/.jimmy_jukebox/rock.txt
    - ~/.jimmy_jukebox/country.txt
    - etc.
 - Inside each file, each row names the top of a music directory tree (no need to escape spaces and other frequently escaped characters)
    - For example, ~/.jimmy_jukebox/rock.txt might contain the following:
        ~/My_rock_files/The_Beatles
        ~/My_rock_files/The Eagles
        /home/my_name/My_rock_files/The_Rolling_Stones
 - To play music stored in the directory trees specified in ~/.jimmy_jukebox/jazz.txt, run "play_jukebox jazz.txt"

== TROUBLESHOOTING

- Are you running a Windows machine? Solution: Get a real Unix/Linux/Mac machine.

- Are you running JRuby? Solution: Set your GEM_HOME and PATH variables to call "Matz" Ruby (aka MRI, CRuby and "regular" Ruby) before calling JRuby (OPTIONAL: then contact the JRuby gurus and very nicely encourage them to enable "fork")

If you're a JRuby user (like me), you may be disappointed that JimmyJukebox doesn't work with JRuby. JRuby generates a "NotImplementedError: fork is not available on this platform" exception because "JRuby doesn't implement fork() on any platform, including those where fork() is available in MRI" (http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/DifferencesBetweenMriAndJruby#Fork_is_not_implemented). There is an experimental "fork" feature in JRuby callable on the command line with "-J-Djruby.fork.enabled=true" but the feature is labelled "(EXPERIMENTAL, maybe dangerous)" (see http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/PerformanceTuning#Native_Support_Runtime_Properties).

== LEGAL DISCLAIMER
 - Download music at your own risk. I DO NOT guarantee that any music this program
   enables you to download is in the public domain, but the music is all from a reputable
   website (archive.org), and most/all of the songs seem to have been uploaded by someone
   who vouched that they are now in the public domain. Many of the songs are old enough
   that they are no longer eligible for copyright protection. More recently recorded songs
   may or may not be in the public domain, but copyright law is very complex, and it is
   often difficult or impossible to determine whether or not a particular song currently
   enjoys copyright protection.
