JimmyJukebox README

To play MP3 files, you must have installed the program "mpg123."

To play OGG files, you must have installed the program "ogg123."

By default, JimmyJukebox will play (in random order) all MP3 files in your '~/Music' directory. You can override this default either by passing a directory name as a command line parameter (example: "") or by passing the name of a file containing a list of directory names.
