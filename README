JimmyJukebox README

Basic usage:
 - On the command line, type "play_jukebox"
 - By default, JimmyJukebox assumes your music is stored in a directory tree descending from "~/Music"

Method 1 for telling JimmyJukebox where to find your music:
 - On the command line, type "play_jukebox DIRECTORY_NAME" where DIRECTORY_NAME is the path to the top of your music directory tree
 - For example, "play_jukebox ~/Music/JAZZ"

Method 2 for telling JimmyJukebox where to find your music:
 - Create a ~/.jimmy_jukebox directory
 - Create a file in ~/.jimmy_jukebox named "whatever.txt"
 - Inside the file, each row names the top of a music directory tree
 - For example, ~/.jimmy_jukebox/rock.txt might contain the following:
   ~/My_rock_files/The_Beatles
   /home/my_name/My_rock_files/The_Rolling_Stones

Requirements:
 - A Unix/Linux/Mac machine (because JimmyJukebox currently does not work on Windows)
 - The program "mpg123" to play MP3 files
 - The program "ogg123" to play OGG files

By default, JimmyJukebox will play (in random order) all MP3 files in your '~/Music' directory. You can override this default either by passing a directory name as a command line parameter (example: "") or by passing the name of a file containing a list of directory names.

If you're a JRuby user (like me), you may be disappointed that play_jukebox uses "#!/usr/bin/ruby" rather than "#!/usr/bin/env ruby." I force the use of Matz Ruby because JRuby generates a "NotImplementedError: fork is not available on this platform" exception because "JRuby doesn't implement fork() on any platform, including those where fork() is available in MRI" (http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/DifferencesBetweenMriAndJruby#Fork_is_not_implemented). There is an experimental "fork" feature in JRuby callable on the command line with "-J-Djruby.fork.enabled=true" but the feature is labelled "(EXPERIMENTAL, maybe dangerous)" (see http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/PerformanceTuning#Native_Support_Runtime_Properties).

Troubleshooting:
 - Are you running a Windows machine? Solution: Get a real Unix/Linux/Mac.
 - Are you running JRuby? Solution: Set your GEM_HOME and PATH variables to call Matz Ruby before JRuby (and then contact the JRuby gurus and very nicely ask them to enable "fork" ...see above)
